# CRU-Bot
CRU-bot is an initiative by the SMU CRU (formerly SMU Campus Crusade for Christ) Servant Team to automate tasks in support of day to day operations and events. Currently, there are several intended features: 

1. Sending daily polls to support the CRUNCH (CRU Lunch) initiative 
2. Run an email server that reports the size of emails
3. Inform members who volunteer hours to book facilities via SMU FBS
